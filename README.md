## 🎯 Objectives
- Select a random element
- Conditional statements (if)

## ✔️ Specifications
### 🌱 Must-haves
See [rock-paper-scissors](https://github.com/EvaRoets/rock-paper-scissors/blob/main/README.md)

### 🌻 Nice-to-haves
- Add extra options for the player: lizard & spock
- Keep track of the score after multiple games
- Show what the player picked by highlighting the correct button
- Add more options for a player to choose from (example: a risky option that awards more points but has a higher chance of losing)
- Add even more options (but avoid using 100 if statements)
- Can you make a player win 100% of the games? Or win 75%? (not to raise any suspicion)
